# Churn_Prediction
Predicting tele-communication churn using analytics


# Problem_Statement
In telecom companies, Churn is identified as loss of customers to competition with other carriers. This project is about enabling churn reduction using analytics.
In this project, we had to use historical data from ACB Wireless Inc. to build a model that can predict/identify their customers who are likely to churn. Any modeling technique/ approach can be used. This model can be used to predict the likelihood of churn for a list of customers that was provided. 
So here the repository has an commented R-script for modelling and identifying the customers with churn probability, a .csv file of the given data and the project report explaining the details about each step and the R-script.
